Through discussion, hands-on activites, and exposition students will develop their capacity to communicate naturally in English on contemporary design issues through the lens of the 4 phase design process (ie double-diamond model). Using the basic methods of contextual inquiry (observation and interview), students will particpate in a 'design sprint' as a way to gain first-hand understanding of vocabulary and the communication skills necessary for their practice as designers."},{"0":"授業方法","1":"This class will follow a 'hybrid' model of lecture, student presentation, critique, group discussion, and team-based activities conducted completely in English.
