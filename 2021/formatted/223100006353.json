Despite all this, our encounters with art do always go as well as they might.. What if art has a purpose that can be defined and discussed in plain terms?  Art can be a tool, and we need to focus more clearly on what kind of tool it is - and what good it can do for us.\"  - Art As Therapy, Alain de Botton & John ArmstrongThis course, presenting a new way of looking at art, is designed to encourage students to grow into enthusiastic and expressive communicators who feel comfortable and confident speaking in English - whether or not it's perfect - and opening themselves and their ideas up to the wider world.  Together we will explore the functions of art and unpick the big question: What Is Art For? through four main themes that cover love, nature, money and politics.  Our focus will be speaking, so there will be ample opportunity for real time conversation.  Students will strengthen their communication skills through a combination of art assignments, an exploration of artworks and discussion.  Art assignments will allow for both personal reflection on topics covered and an opportunity for engagement and exchange in sharing work with others.  The exploration of artwork will span the story of art from cave paintings to contemporary practice and develop vocabulary and critique.  Discussion will encompass the main themes of art and its purpose.  The course will culminate in a final presentation celebration where students will select and share a favourite piece of work created during the course and celebrate a 'breakthrough moment' with the group.","授業方法":"英語で行う授業　Presentation and discussion.
