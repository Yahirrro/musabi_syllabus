In particular, generative art tools and techniques, as well as output devices such as 3D printers and laser cutters, allow us to make forms which would be impossible any other way. These cultural changes also allow us to appreciate the hand in new ways. This course will allow students to examine the relationship between hand-based approaches to 3D form making and generative approaches. Classes will include both theory and practice. Discussions will center on critical approaches and concepts for describing art, especially sculpture, in the digital age.","授業方法":"対面による授業","到達目標":"Learn to use digital art-making processes along with hand-based processes. Learn to describe and critique new sculpture in English.","ディプロマポリシーとの関連":"https://www.musabi.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CurriculumMap_scp.pdf","授業計画・課題に対するフィードバック":"NOTE: Syllabus will be explained in full at OrientationNOTE: All assignments must be kept, and documented (photos etc).
